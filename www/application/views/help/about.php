  <p><b>Our Mission</b>
<p><b></b>
<p>The purposes of a bibliographical study are well - known. The main objective of a bibliographer is to assist the researcher, the academician, the student and the professional, in finding the relevant material. In the case of a legal bibliography, the organized classification of materials also contributes to the enhancement of the legal order and the system of justice, since the advocate, the judge and the legislator may, if they so wish, find the relevant primary or secondary material, and use it accordingly. The present Edition aims to cover an important vacuum of the Cypriot legal bibliography and facilitate the advance of legal science. 
<p>It is of course self-evident that the bibliographer does not share all the views presented in the cited material. Books and articles dealing with Cypriot law have been included irrespective of their quality and of personal preferences. This includes books and articles that present the Turkish views of the legal aspects of the Cyprus problem. Truth’s chances are better with freedom than with repression and it is the essence of a bibliography that all material should be presented, irrespective of the personal views of the bibliographer. 
<p>The Digital Edition will be constantly updated with new bibliographical additions and will remain open to the public and free of charge.

<p><b>History</b>
<p>The first attempt to organize the bibliography of Cypriot law was undertaken, more than thirty-five years ago, by Constantinos A. Emilianides who published a bibliography of Cypriot Law in 1974, just prior to the Turkish Invasion of Cyprus (Αιμιλιανίδης Κωνσταντίνος, <i>Βιβλιογραφία </i><i>Κυπριακού </i><i>Δικαίου</i>, Εκδόσεις Ινστιτούτου Δημοσίου Διεθνούς Δικαίου και Διεθνών Σχέσεων Θεσσαλονίκης, Θεσσαλονίκη, 1974, σσ. 45). Since then, there has naturally been a significant increase of books and articles dealing with the various aspects of the Cypriot law. 
<p>In 2005 Achilles C. Emilianides edited and published his <i>Bibliography of Cypriot Law</i>, Power Publishing, Nicosia, pp. 120, which has been transformed and updated into the current Digital Edition. The Digital Edition is a completely new edition that has not only been updated, but also it has been reworked and redesigned so as to correspond to the needs of a Digital Bibliographical Database. 
<p>&nbsp; <p><b>Material Included </b>
<p>The present Digital Edition contains books, chapters in books and articles published in legal journals or conference proceedings, which deal with Cypriot law. Therefore, books or articles of Cypriot lawyers which do not deal with Cypriot law, but with foreign law, or general European or International law have not been included in this bibliography. Books or articles which deal with Cypriot law only incidentally, have also not been included in this bibliography. 
<p>In aspects such as legal history, ecclesiastical law, or the legal aspects of the Cyprus problem, every attempt has been made so that the cited books and articles are of primary concern to the lawyer and not to the political scientist, or the historian. Where there is a revised edition of the work (e.g. Neocleous Introduction to Cyprus Law, or chapters on Cyprus in annually updated series), articles contained in previous editions are not included in the Digital Bibliography. 
<p>In view of the rarity of publications in certain fields of law, the 2005 Print Edition contained material such as brief case summaries/comments, or brief notices of legislative developments, Q and A in professional publications etc. While such material has been retained in the Digital Database, updates from 2006 onwards only include such material if it is considered to be of importance to the average researcher due to lack of similar material. 
<p>&nbsp; <p><b>Structure of the Digital Bibliography of Cyprus Law </b>
<p>The main body of the present work contains over 1500 bibliographical references and 30 main categories, which were drafted so that the bibliography is as easy to use as possible. The categorisation aims not to achieve legal precision, but rather to enable the researchers and users to find the material they are looking for. 
<p>Bibliographical references contained in the Digital Database may be searched either by category or by author’s name. For most of the authors a brief biography may be viewed by pressing on the author’s name. 
<p>A special section of the Bibliography includes main <a href="http://kede-cyprus.org/law3/index.php/help/viewhelp/sources"><b>Sources</b></a> in so far as Legislation, Case-Law Reports, Indexes and Legal Periodicals are concerned.
